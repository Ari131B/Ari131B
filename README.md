# Script Documentation: Package Installation and Configuration

## Overview

This Bash script is designed to automate the installation and configuration of various packages on a Unix-like system. It checks for the availability of the package manager (`pkg`), upgrades system packages, installs the `x11-repo` package repository, and installs specific packages such as `openssl-1.1`, `tigervnc`, `xfce4`, `firefox`, and `xterm`.

## Prerequisites

- **pkg Package Manager:** Ensure that the `pkg` package manager is installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the script directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x your_script.sh
    ```

4. Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./your_script.sh
    ```

## Functionality
